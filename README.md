# conduct

SpaceShuttl's Code of Conduct. This document originates from [Go's Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct), and is modified to better suit our needs.

## Why have a Code of Conduct?

Online communities include people from different backgrounds. The SpaceShuttl crew commit to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of acceptable behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can interact with the
SpaceShuttl community appropriately.

The second goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for SpaceShuttl to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.

With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement, debate, and barter. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

If you join in or contribute to SpaceShuttl in any way, we encourage you to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.

Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to the following, operated by SpaceShuttl:
* The official GitHub projects and code reviews
* The spaceshuttl Slack team

## Values

These are the values of which people in the SpaceShuttl community should aspire.

* Be friendly and welcoming
* Be patient
  * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
* Be thoughtful
  * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
  * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
* Be respectful
  * In particular, respect differences of opinion.
* Be charitable
  * Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  * When we do disagree, try to understand why.
* Avoid destructive behavior:
  * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  * Unconstructive criticism: offer suggestions on how to improve.
  * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  * Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  * Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

## Unwelcome behavior

These actions are explicitly forbidden in SpaceShutl spaces:

* Unwelcome sexual advances.
* Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
* Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
* Bullying or systematic harassment.
* Incitement to any of these.

## Moderation

The SpaceShuttl spaces have moderators. The goal of a moderator is to encourage civil discussion, and ensure the Code of Conduct is in effect.

When using the official SpaceShuttl spaces you should act in the spirit of the our values. If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the CoC, you will receive a warning and asked to stop. If you do not stop, you will be removed from our community spaces temporarily. Repeated, willful breaches of the CoC will result in a permanent ban.

Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others, and should expect to be removed from their position if they cannot adhere to the CoC.

Complaints about moderator actions are handled using the reporting process below.

## Reporting issues

If you discover an issue with a moderator, or another member of the community, please report it to a member of staff - detailed below.

## Summary

Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Be thoughtful in how you communicate. Don't be destructive or inflammatory.
